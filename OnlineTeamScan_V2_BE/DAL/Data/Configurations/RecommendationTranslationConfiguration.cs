This exercise consists of three simple questions, takes no more than 25 minutes and without fail, team members walk away with a deeper knowledge of one another’s stories. This is a great place to start building vulnerability and trust on the team." },

Personality instruments (i.e., Myers-Briggs, DiSC or Social Styles) help team members understand one another’s different preferences, skills and attitudes, and identify collective strengths and potential blind spots of the team. This will help team members avoid making unproductive judgments about one another and instead leverage the diverse approaches and perspectives of the team." },

When individuals on a team are humble, hungry, and smart, it makes overcoming the five dysfunctions of a team much more attainable. This self-ranking exercise is a great way for team members to assess themselves against the three virtues and build trust by sharing with the team." },

That means working hard to build vulnerability-based trust with one another. It’s hard enough for people who work in the same office every day and who look at each other in the face during meetings to do this well. Teams who don’t have that luxury are going to have to be much more intentional about getting to know one another during their virtual meetings and when they are together." },

Real-time permission is when the leader interrupts team members who are in the midst of an uncustomary debate, to remind them that what they are doing is okay. It is the role of the leader to provide real-time permission when healthy conflict is occurring, encouraging the team to continue to passionately debate in pursuit of the best answer." },

Having clear standards of behavior allows a team to focus on the discussion of issues without having to slow down to think about what is and is not appropriate. Capture the team conflict norms and refer to them in meetings." },

At the middle of the continuum is the point where conflict changes from constructive and ideological to destructive and personal. View the video on the conflict continuum and discuss where the team might fall on the scale. Discuss ways artificial harmony shows up and identify how to introduce more healthy conflict into team meetings and discussions." },

The use of this simple exercise, called cascading communication, demonstrates a public commitment to agreements and aligns employees throughout the organization around common objectives. Even naturally hesitant team members commit to decisions when they have communicated them to their direct reports." },

Leaders of teams who commit to decisions demand that their people eliminate ambiguity and leave meetings and discussions clear about what they are agreeing to do. Do the hard work of wrestling issues to the ground. Be sure not to shy away from lively, often lengthy discussion around big strategic topics or to move on to new agenda items too early for the sake of time." },

Start a weekly meeting with a lightning round. A lightning round allows each team members 30 seconds to share what they are working on in the coming week. When team members keep one another informed about what they are doing, it allows peers to provide feedback and advice on whether team members are focused on the right things as well as ensure those things are moving toward completion." },

Results suffer when team members put a higher priority on the activities of their own departments or divisions. Review the video and ensure each individual commits to the team goals/results as his/her top priority." },
